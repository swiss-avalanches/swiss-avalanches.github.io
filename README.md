# Swiss avalanches

This is a "Data for social good" project started for the course of [Applied data analysis](https://dlab.epfl.ch/teaching/fall2017/cs401/) taught by Prof. West. It received the Best project award (5 out of 100) and was presented during the [Applied Machine Learning days '18](https://www.appliedmldays.org) in Lausanne. You can check out the [website](https://swiss-avalanches.github.io) and our [poster]()



Risk zero does not exist in alpinism. Statistical models have been developed to assess this risk but they do not prevent tragedies. We do not claim that we can do better, but given that most of the accidents are due to bad people decisions, we are convinced that raising concern about the past mountaineering accidents can strongly improve alpinists' judgement in the future. The aim of this project is to gather meteorological and environmental data (weather condition, precipitations, snowpack, wind, temperatures, slopes, exposures, time of dayâ€¦) along with avalanche cases and casualties. By leveraging means of interactive visualization, we will provide the skiers ways to understand the conditions of previous cases and maybe hints that could have changed the outcome. Our observational study will focus on the Swiss Alps.

### Data

We scrapped data from the [SLF archive] 



We added this README after the misunderstanding about what we had to submit.

Our main result is the [website](https://swiss-avalanches.github.io) coded in JS and D3.js. You can find the notebooks that back our datastory [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/swiss-avalanches/swiss-avalanches.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/data_story.ipynb) and the maps extraction [there](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/swiss-avalanches/swiss-avalanches.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/run_through_map_extraction.ipynb).

We mostly worked together, the following break down is more or less informative.

| Name          | Main task          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Brune         | Maps extraction    |
| Jean-Baptiste | Data visualisation |
| Arnaud        | Data story         |

We will work together on the final presentation, Brune will present it.
